# Tube-Audio-Amplifier

This is one of the last projects I worked on before going to university. I love audio and wanted to try to build my own vacuum tube amplifier. I designed this amplifier to use a 12AX7 pre-amp with a 2W linear solid-state amp. This would give me the benefit of both the nice sound of tubes, and the power of a linear solid-state amplifier. Unfortunately, I only got around to building the tube amplifier, but it sounded stunning nonetheless! 

The two boards on the left are the power supplies, the bottom board converts the 18VDC to 250VDC for the tubes and the top board converts 18VDC to 6.3VDC for the heating elements. The right board is the actual amplifier. Each tube is used for one audio channel.
